# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This project contains my solutions to the daily coding challenges presented in the Advent of Code 2024. Each day's challenge has its own Rust project with independent dependencies and build configurations.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. Each day, a new problem is released, and participants are tasked with solving it using any programming language of their choice. More information and the daily challenges can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into subdirectories for each day of the Advent of Code 2024 challenge. Each subdirectory is a standalone Rust project:
